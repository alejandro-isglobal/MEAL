}
\arguments{
\item{set}{\code{MethylationSet}, \code{ExpressionSet} or \code{MultiDataSet}.}

\item{range}{\code{GenomicRanges} with the desired range.}

\item{omicset}{In a \code{MultiDataSet} allows to choose between methylation and
expression (valid values are: "methylation" or "expression").}

\item{variable_names}{Character vector with the names of the variables that
will be returned as result.}

\item{variable_types}{Character vector with the types of the variables. By
default, variables type won't be changed.}

\item{covariable_names}{Character vector with the names of the variables that
will be used to adjust the model.}

\item{covariable_types}{Character vector with the types of the covariables. By
default, variables type won't be changed.}

\item{equation}{String containing the formula to be used to create
the model.}

\item{num_var}{Numeric with the number of variables in the matrix for which the
analysis will be performed. Compulsory if equation is not null.}

\item{labels}{Character vector with the labels of the variables.}

\item{sva}{Logical indicating if Surrogate Variable Analysis should be applied.}

\item{use_snps}{Logical indicating if SNPs should be used in the analysis.}

\item{snps_cutoff}{Numerical with the threshold to consider a SNP-cpg correlation
p-value significant.}

\item{region_methods}{Character vector with the methods used in \code{DARegion}. If
"none", region analysis is not performed.}

\item{shrinkVar}{Logical indicating if shrinkage of variance should be applied
in probe analysis.}

\item{probe_method}{Character with the type of linear regression applied in
probe analysis ("ls" or "robust")}

\item{max_iterations}{Numeric with the maximum of iterations in the robust
regression.}

\item{num_cores}{Numeric with the number of cores to be used.}

\item{verbose}{Logical value. If TRUE, it writes out some messages indicating progress.
If FALSE nothing should be printed.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passsed to \code{DAPipeline} function.}

\description{
Methylation analysis in a genomic range, taking into account snps.
}
\details{
Set is filtered to the range specified. If SNPs are present in the set,
those are also filtered and then, correlation between SNPs and cpgs is tested.
SNPs that are correlated to at least one cpg are added to covariables. After that,
\code{DAPipeline} is run. RDA test of the region is performed, returning the
R2 between the variables and the beta matrix and a p-value of this R2.

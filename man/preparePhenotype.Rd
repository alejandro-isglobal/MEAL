\title{Process a table of phenotypes}
\usage{
preparePhenotype(phenotypes, variable_names, variable_types = rep(NA,
  length(variable_names)))
}
\arguments{
\item{phenotypes}{Data.frame with the phenotypic features}

\item{variable_names}{Vector with the names or the positions of the desired
variables.}

\item{variable_types}{Vector with the types of the variables.}
}
\value{
Data.frame with the columns selected and with the types desired.
}
\description{
Given a data.frame containing phenotypic variables, select the desired columns
and transform them to the desired types.
}
\details{
\code{preparePhenotype} supports five types of variables. Categorical 
and continuous correspond to factor and numerical types in R. The other three
are genomic models as defined in \code{SNPassoc}: dominant, recessive and additive.
In order to use these types, only two alleles can be present and genotypes should
be specified in the form \emph{a/b}. 

If transformation of variables is not needed, the variable_types can be passed
as a vector of \code{NA}.

\examples{
pheno <- data.frame(a = sample(letters[1:2], 5, replace = TRUE), b = runif(5), 
c = sample(c("a/a","a/b", "b/b"), 5, replace = TRUE))
pheno <- preparePhenotype(pheno, variable_names = c("a", "c"), 
variable_types = c("categorical", "dominant"))
pheno
